# 1. Reading Images and Videos:
    This is written in object oriented form. I want to use this as a library for further projects. 
    Additional functions will soon be added to this.
    This is just a basic class for reading Images and Videos and plot the image, gray scale image etc.
    if specified.
    
# 2. Drawing and Writing on Images:
    This folder contains the functions with which multiple shapes like line, rectangle, polygons, circle
    and also write on Images.
    It also has a User Handling system with which user can select which shape they want.
    
 # 3. Arithmetics and Logic
    Image arithmetics and logics like adding images together, performing addition using weighted sum.
    Super Imposing Images is also one of the important function that is performed.
    
 # 4. Color Filtering
    A basic filtering function. Change the lower and upper red (colors) to what is suitable for you.
    
 # 5. Smoothening and Blurring
    This contains a read images function and blurring function using filter2D functions. Other filtering
    techniques are also mentioned in the code (but is commented)
    
 # 6. Edge Detection
    Two functions called apply_gradient() and edge_detect() are written in a form that can be used in other 
    codes as well. The image used here is of a pikachu. (pika-pika). Result can be found in the same folder. 
    The images are shown only if the condition is provided. It comes in handy when we just want to read a 
    particular image and not show it. 
    
 # 7. Template Matching
    Template matching is one of the important and interesting fields used in various applications like self
    driving cars, etc. I have made use of the Super Mario obstacles for this code.
    In the folder Where's Waldo the template matching is performed to find Waldo from the image. Both the
    templates and images used are in the folder.
    
 # 8. Face and Eye Detector Project
    Using the dataset from openCV itself, face and eye can be detected on a Video Feed or any image.
